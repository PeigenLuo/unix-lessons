UNIX Lesson 1
=============

Challenges
----------

Navigation:

- [ ] Use `cd` and `ls` to navigate around the repository. List all of the files inside the `fruity` directory.
  - [ ] Now use `cat` to read each of those files. What's inside each of them?
- [ ] Create a directory called `foo`.
  - [ ] Now create a directory called `bar` inside of the `foo` directory, and another one outside of the `foo` directory.
  - [ ] Use `touch` to create a new file. Create a file called `elephant` in the `bar` directory that's inside the `foo` directory, and then another file called `poodle` in the other `bar` directory you made.
  - [ ] Use `cd` to go back to the root of the repository.

Executing files:

- [ ] `cd` to the directory called `executables`.
- [ ] Run the file `exec1`. What is its output?
- [ ] Why can't you run the file `exec2`? How can you change that?
- [ ] Try to run the file `exec3`, but do it the same way you ran the previous executables. Don't use `python` or `python3` to run it.

Filesystem Hierarchy:

- [ ] Open a new terminal, but keep your current one open. You should have two terminals now. In the second one, type `./magic`. This should drop you into another shell. You should see a prompt starting with `$`.
